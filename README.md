**NOTE: This site will be updated to use Laravel in the coming days, and may not be live for a short period.
The website is located at: http://covid-19-stats.epizy.com/



This is a website that displays Covid-19 statistics, predominantly focused on Canadian Statistics. Each Canadian Province/Territory has its own section along with associated graphs that display cumulative and daily statistics.

The global stats are held in a table at the top of the front page and may sometimes not show proper data due to updates occuring at the time.
